I assumed that lg and trf pipelines would produce ate -> eat while the sm and md pipelines would produce ate -> ate, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  

def eat_lemma(lang_pipeline):
    nlp = spacy.load(lang_pipeline)
    doc = nlp(""ate"")
    print(lang_pipeline, '|', doc[0].lemma_)

lp = [""en_core_web_sm"", ""en_core_web_md"", ""en_core_web_lg"", ""en_core_web_trf""]
for lang_pipeline in lp:
    eat_lemma(lang_pipeline)

en_core_web_sm | ['eat']
en_core_web_md | ['ate']
en_core_web_lg | ['eat']

I never know how much I get pissed off when these companies call, pester and push the parents to enroll their kids to AI or Coding. Funniest part is they say they have coding classes for 2nd or 3rd grader when these age kids really learn to spell the word coding. Sundar pichai or Sathya nadella did not learn coding in 2nd grade. I would rather blame parents trying to push these children to learn something that is not necessary. What will a future doctor or even a designer or artist has to do with coding?"

The challenge is you are associating learning with IT and career. Also, such learning has nothing to with other childhood activities when done out of self interest and passion and not by force. Every child is different and not everybody has to become singer. A proper balance is required for overall developement which is true at any age and not just at Childhood. The critical part is way of learning and not the age or learning itself."

That said, I have discovered that the most important factor for choosing your career is actually not your passion, but your personality.

On the other hand, I had always found coding boring in my school days, but recently realised it suits my personality the best and have now become passionate about it."

34,The New Beginning,2022-04-15,33035,2050,rinisbstn,"Hi Sir, 
Though B-tech graduate, with direct placement in TCS, I never could enjoy coding(never understood it and I started believing it's not my cup of tea). Marriage was an excuse to resign the job and go abroad with my husband thinking I could do something else and I did (administration field). But again after taking a break(having kids) I started thinking what to do next. It's then I accidentally came across your video on data analyst Vs data science. It was first time in my life , that an IT related topic aroused my interest. I decided to give it a try (3 months road map to data analyst) and I'm following and learning from your channel. Getting a job in  this field is of course my aim now but more than that.. YOU HELPED ME TO COME OUT OF CODING FEAR!! Thank you so much sir, you are a gift , you explain everything in such a simple manner that I understand things which I couldn't in the past so many years. I'm afraid to follow anything other than your teachings because it might confuse me. As the kid says in the movie 'the karate kid'(final scene) , 'no matter I win or loose , tonight when I go I don't want to be afraid anymore'. That's what you have helped me to achieve. THANK YOU SO MUCH sir.! GOD BLESS YOU!"
34,The New Beginning,2022-04-15,33035,2050,KRISHNA KABI,It’s so inspiring!! We all want to just reach at the next big thing that someone else has and may be then we would feel content.

I rethought about everything, thought about who I had around me, learnt how to code and haven’t looked back since. 

This was one of the first channels I came across and used it a lot. Thanks for the vids! I probably wouldn’t have become a data engineer without learning through these youtube channels :)"

Your story is inspirational and 'packs' on top of my optimum respect for fellows coming from India, particularly those in the field of Tech. I respect India, as a country, for producing reasonable, intelligent, willing-to-give citizens. Infact, government of India has been proven to be a willing government, at least based on my assessment. Take for instance, those government-initiated Tech projects, that not only benefit Indians, but all of us around the globe. So, no wonder your character, your 'home environment' taught you well.

34,The New Beginning,2022-04-15,33035,2050,,"CORRECTION: If your h1b doesn't get picked up in all 3 tries after masters, you can do another master and while you are studying, you get something called CPT (OPT is something you do after your studies, CPT is something you can do in parallel with your studies) and during CPT you can apply for h1b.  Hence you got total 5 chaces (5 during CPT, 2 during OPT). 
Other option is if you go for studies that is one level up. i.e. PHD, then you get 3 tries for H1B and 3 years of OPT.

34,The New Beginning,2022-04-15,33035,2050,D. Ganguly,"Your observation is absolutely correct. As Canadian PR. I would say after obtaining Masters from Canadian University finding job initially is bit difficult. Salary too is a bit lower in comparison to USA. But it is almost certain that you will given PR CARD within 3 years . Another great facility in Canada is free medical & all clinical tests . Even hospitalisation & operations are free. For Seniors all medicines are free of cost which is impossible & unthinkable in USA. Absolutely pollution free great cities & round the year beautiful weather. Albeit winter months are a bit painful if out on street. But seldom anybody found on road like India. Cars & car seats are all heated so problem whatsoever.

Under USMCA agreement, for certain occupations such as engineers and registered nurses, Canadians can work in US via a 3-yr non-immigration TN-1 visa which can be renewed as many times as required. TN-1 visa can be applied and obtained in US-Canada border crossing or in some airports by presenting the necessary documents and paying a fee (about $56 USD).

34,The New Beginning,2022-04-15,33035,2050,Mohin Hasin Rabbi,"If an individual has already used the 12/36 months of Masters level OPT they were granted for their first Masters, they are not eligible for OPT after second Masters. Even if your Master's degree is an entirely different field, you will not be eligible for another 12/36 month period of OPT.

With that said, anyone planning to manage the next OPT would need to go for PhD preferably in a STEM field
(because stem: 36 months, non-stem: 12 months) and step in for the OPT cycle again, while the designated company you work will apply for H1B visa, till the algorithm picks your name, from the lottery.

With Labor Cert, you have to prove to US government that you are not stealing American jobs and that your position is indeed needed. Your employer has to pay you a fair wage for the position.

His idea of logotherapy is the idea of people’s innate nature to minimise depression by enjoying/suffering from the path towards a meaning/purpose/fashion - even if the goal is challenging. The Ikigai book is definitely a good follow up to this.

Basically, all the outliers were the 0s for blood pressure and cholesterol. With those eliminated, I got significantly higher scores than the solution. All bagged models gave a similar 86% accuracy. The biggest jump from non-bagged model to bagged model was the Decision Tree which went from 79% accuracy without bagging to 86% with bagging. Also, I did the exercise several months after this video (was posted - not sure when it was made), so the libraries (especially SVC) may have improved (in their defaults)."

Great content. The best in YT on bias and variance. I have a doubt - from 07:35 - 07:40 in the video, while we are looking at an ideal model, there are two curves which have been shown - meaning these are two different models. I thought we are looking into finding a single model which has a balanced fit. While we are varying the training dataset, the model also is changed. I feel it should the same curve for different training datasets. "

What if while training a neural network it’s loss sometimes increase and decrease and when I plot the error I found a very weird like up and down curves ((but at the end the loss was balanced )). So do we consider this overfitting? And thanks again.

Again, if I do pca on train data, is same will the same pca can be applied on test data? Is there anyway to store the transformation of PCA to apply that on test data?"

I might not be making any sense here but I wanted to know if same thing could be achieved with entropy and information gain. We know information gain tells you the feature with the most information or importance as a number . Therefore, in theory, we can remove all the features with really low information gains. I think it would this would work with discrete data better. I don't know if it already exists. If it does, what method does this. If it doesn't, can I know if this solution is practical."

Please make more so that I/we can learn more. If possible, come to Bangladesh, please let us know. It will be a sheer pleasure for us. If I am capable of it, I will come to meet with you!
A little request from your playlist 45 and 48 was essential, so please make a new one in detail, especially 48 no videos.

a) Transfer Learning                                                                                                                                                                                                
b) Transformers
c) GANs
d) Autoencoders
e) Inception V3 Networks
f) Siamese Neural Networks.
We would indeed appreciate videos on the aforesaid topics. 

Apart from this, DL algorithm on Medical/Healthcare Imaging (Ultra Sonography, MRI, or CT Scan---on any one of them) would indeed be appreciated. Thanks in advance!!!

133,How I Learned Data Science | My Data Science Journey,2021-05-24,80266,3169,kpmgadvisory,"This is all great but in real life, no company gives a shit if u are self-learn unless u created your own startup with a high valuation. after working for many years in top MNCs I realized there is only one rule in life - learn from the right place. Do to from IIT, IIM, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, etc etc. No one gives a fuck to a guy from Lucknow University or Allahabad University or any local university who learned python from online resources. Just go to LinkedIn in search of people who are data scientists u will know what are their background. Most will have Ph.D. from top schools or an advanced master's degree at the minimum. it is a simple concept we Indians don't get....if we want a high salary in data science and expect MNC to pay us big bucks then why MNCs will hire local guys with self-learning skills. They simply go to top-tier schools and hire the best minds. No one wants to take risks.   now in the case of 'Dhaval Patel', he already landed a job in software engineering at Bloomberg so it is easy to iterate Data science/ML projects n then self-proclaim yourself as Data Scientist. So if you want to just write AI/ML in your LinkedIn then do these online training but if you want to be paid like an AI/ML data scientist then study seriously in a structured program at an ivy league in US or IIT/IISc/IIM/ISB in India or Oxford/Cambridge/Imperial/ in the UK. finally, BRANDS SELL FASTER THAN YOUR KNOWLEDGE GUYS! ACCEPT IT AND ITS THE TRUTH. If Dhaval Patel was from a top-tier college he would have been a VP of Data Science at Bloomberg by now! Comments welcome if you disagree."

So, my question to you is that how can I learn app development other than my approach that I told you about previously. I'm willing to learn app development so I hope to hear back from you soon about applications development for IOS and Android. Thank you sir and thank you your channels and for this video."

Is there a way here?"

A question re: log(income) use case at 5:35 please. 
While log scales down the super high income, it's also compreses other income amounts, most of them at same order of magnitude. Wouldn't that create a new problem: the log-ed incomes are now too close to each other? Wouldn't it impact the ML ability to predict results?"

147,"What is Standard Deviation and Mean Absolute Deviation | Math, Statistics for data science, ML",2021-04-23,46579,1383,Marissa Valente,"As a Senior Analyst with an MBA in Business Analytics, I definitely appreciate this video. It takes a full team to understand, utilize, and implement data findings. In terms of your explained definitions, I think that either a data analyst or a business analyst can hone their abilities and grow their role/skillset to become a hybrid of these two roles. I sit in a role that is a combination of these two roles, it's definitely not mutually exclusive but usually the career path starts with one or the other and either develops more in one area or can develop in both depending on what your career goals are. I agree that the business analyst will focus on the business aspects more, while the data analyst will typically have more technical skills."

148,Introduction | Mathematics and statistics for data science and machine learning,2021-04-18,133265,3369,Sameer Singh,I am a Sr. BA and business analysis field is quite diverse in context of how different company sees it. It can cover areas from strategy all the way down to operational/delivery. It is very contextual driven which means at one time you may be developing a business case for a problem and on other hand doing  requirments gathering or analysis or for that matter doing problem identification/framing driven by data analysis.
148,Introduction | Mathematics and statistics for data science and machine learning,2021-04-18,133265,3369,Glenda Peace,"Hi! Thanks for this explanation. Would you say finding individuals that excel at being a hybrid is common? In my case I could do both roles, but I lean more towards the business analysis side, I feel employers have a hard time finding these ""unicorns"" that excel at both sets of skills. I have recruiter friends who have confirmed this for me and myself, I have participated in job fairs looking for this profile where it has been clear that most of the candidates we prescreened who have impressive data skills but do not have the business insights and consulting skills. Also from a job load perspective, both sets of tasks require time and focus, so managing 3 simultaneuos projects, constantly switching between tasks can be challenging. What are your thoughts?"

157,How bitcoin miners collect their reward? | How miners send mining reward in their digital wallet?,2021-04-05,25756,606,Ashish Sahu,"Exactly! I had been to same place and took a decision to pursue CS rather than DS. You see, the thing is, Information technology is itself very changing field time to time in terms of job market. The job market hype could be Java Net BlockChain AI Data science etc. You can name any... But what Dienst change ever since 40 year back is having computer science or mathematical or statistical degree. Having these degree not just get you job ready but transcends through time. For example, At the university, a professor who did Masters in Mathematics in 1960 or 70s is still relevant and is capable to teach mechanics or CS coz that shapes his core education 40 years which is still respectful. Computer science degree at 21sr century will be that ""Still relatable"" degree after 30 years. Hence you should eye for CS not just follow market hypes."

The analogies with which you start every DL concept in your videos are pure gems. Here the examples of players and Australia - with the float value for each dimension ( feature ) is pure streak of genius. One just goes spellbound when the whole concept become so clear.  It is said that great teachers are the ones who make complex things look simple. And when one explains  in simple terns it means that the person has understood it completely. It fits you perfectly. Before watching this video, though I could understand what word vectors were in terms of dimensions but the real meaning(conceptual understanding) become immensely clear when you presented them with values like - Person, Fitness, Location, Has Government - was mind blowing.

Thanks for having made clear these points to the people who were unaware of them. I'm using Python since 1998 and I used it for everything, from web development to data science passing from system administration. The only cases where I found it ""unusable"" was when there was not room enough for the Python interpreter (like in embedded systems). It has never been slow*. It is just a matter to understand *how to use it. Python is a ""glue language"" and is intended to be used to glue together C and C++ libraries, offering a better API to the developer. It is intended to be fast at *developing time*, not at *execution time*. The people who complain about its speed just do not understand this point and just do not know how to use it in the proper way."

The thing is that Python is not that slow as people complain, it's just slower than most of popular languages, but it's still faster than most of the languages, like C# (which is compiled) for instance, Lua between others. Python have several reasons to not be a faster language, one of them is what can make C# faster than Python, which is the use of concurrency in C#. For the design that Python have, it's not that bad performance, but it should be at least as fast as PHP8 to be considered a good performance language. The reason why Python is used so much in machine learning is not related to the speed, but because machine learning is difficult to code and Python is a lot easier than most of the languages that are faster."

This setup will benefit you for your time and gives other the opportunity to have their specific questions answered. Also, since this will be a paid service, people will be respectful of your time.

I however still have a question: In the Yolo v1 paper it is described that the final convolutional output layer is a tensor of 7x7x1024 dimension (Darknet), then the detection follows, where grid cells dimension of 7x7 are defined. My assumption here is, since the dimension of the conv output the same as the grid cell's, can one say that one grid cell represents one pixel, hence the detection proceeds one 'pixel' at a time?"

However , sir can I please ask you to also ponder on Advanced topics. The point being there are many resources for beginners to start on Machine Learning and to get ""Beginners"" tutorial in most of the I.T. field, however there are students like me who started on this journey 6 - 8 months ago and want to know more about advanced topics. Competition is indeed fierce so how can we upskill on our current knowledge. Even if it is End-to-End projects what are the skills in the advanced topic that one can master to be really employable. Can you please talk about it sir?"

Thanks for all this tutorials in ML. 
I've tried to use this syntaxe above, but when i fit my model the score using trainning data is 0.68 whereas the reg.scores using Test data is just weird.score(X_test,Y_test) =--17761722756.9913

dummies=pd.get_dummies(df[['Suburb','Type','Method','SellerG','CouncilArea','Regionname']])

Merge=pd.concat([df,dummies],axis='columns')

final=Merge.drop(['Suburb','Type','Method','SellerG','CouncilArea','Regionname'],axis='columns')

final

2nd part of my question is when i use L1 and L2 Regularization the score seem correct 0.66 and 0.67

I would also mentionned that when i've used LabelEncoder i find a score test data 0.44 and Trainning data 0.42
Thanks in advance for your answers

Because you are trying to predict match won(yhat) which is your horizontal line and age(X) is on vertical line.
Maybe using something unconventional mislead new-learners.
As X is a horizontal line and y is vertical line, that's what we learned since school time.
Assigning X & y to axis(as per your explanation) will be great help to learner.

2) the Regularization expression (Lambda part), my understanding is that we should not take ""i & n"" , rather we should take ""j & m"" etc. The reason is that in first half of equation, we took ""i & n"" for number of rows whereas in second half,  we need to take number of features, so different parameters should be used.

Now we are reaching that population peak (Expected to blow in less than 20 years, some like me think it is already), we can't extract more resources at a sustainable rate (We have a growth limit for population) and automation is just bigger and faster each day, human labour will be outperformed by automatic labour sooner than later, thats simply an objective we are willing to accomplish."

I don't believe that we can or even should fight the changes -- technology is meant to make things easier for us. However we still should not ignore the problem of jobs being lost due to it. Although there will be new jobs, have you considered the scale of the changes? We do not need to look at the types of jobs but rather the demographics of who has which jobs, and what they can do to get one of the ""new"" jobs. using your example of the call center, team of 100 people being replaced with 10 still leaves 90 unemployed."

 Qasim and Dhawal… The content was exceptional. We are all expecting more like this. Thanks once again. 
Now, I have a question for Qasim. When you say $25 per hour, and when the client approaches you. How did/would you negotiate/convince or arrive at the conclusion that this task would require at least these many hours to be completed. When you say and conclude 4 hours to complete the task, you had/have to deliver the work as scheduled or you may take 5 to 6 hours to complete and charge only 4 hours?. Let me put it this way in order to have a better understanding. In-office, if we say 2 hours for a particular task, sometimes it takes more than 2 hours. In such a case, would the client accept if it is delivered beyond the agreed deadline even it is charged for 2 hours? Did you ever go thru this sort of situation?"

The problem I have had with the pyinstaller is that it doesn't work with some common modules.   For instance it didn't work with matplotlib 3.3.? so I had to down grade to 3.2.2 after much wasted time.   Another thing is that you must look at the modules that are included in the final .exe.   The problem I had is that it included many modules I didn't need that added to the code bloat.   The .exe file was so big it took too long to load.   In my case I wasn't using scipy so removing that saved about 30MB.   Numpy and scipy are big modules of compiled fortran.

I am new in NN, I would like to share with you my very naïve comprehension of image augmentation approaches with TensorFlow and keras. 




Built-in TensorFlow modules: tf.image provides data augmentation operations to create a data augmentation routine. tf.data allows to build Tensorflow input pipelines, thus add the augmentation routine as pipeline operation.




TensorFlow-Keras modules, there are two approaches:

tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator, allows image augmentation by customizing parameter values. It handles data preprocessing out of the net model pipe.

tf.keras.layers, provides functions to perform data preprocessing and augmentation, it is used with TensorFlow Sequential class. It handles data preprocessing as part of the model pipe.





It will be great if you can comment! It is not very clear to me the difference between the tools and how they work together. 
Thanks a lot! :)

Variables img_height and img_width are not defined and using (180, 180) in their place and running the cell just gives me the following error :

""NotImplementedError: Cannot convert a symbolic Tensor (random_rotation_5/rotation_matrix/strided_slice:0) to a numpy array. This error may indicate that you're trying to pass a Tensor to a NumPy call, which is not supported""

But if you do it parallely on GPU or in multiple cores on CPU, you only need one or few threads. It saves time and power. And in these days every laptop comes with a powerful GPU of several GigaFlops.
It's a really simple task for the gpu when comparing to the games we play today. On the other hand GPUs are ideal for neural networks as they are highly parallel. The only problem you will face as a developer is it's not that easy to debug as a regular program.

And if those projects also relate to various domains , then it will be super awesome . Like a python project involving some piece of hardware(ECE & EEE students will get interest) , networking , cybersecurity and AI . Then everyone would love to learn the things and can know the dependency of one domain on another ."

256,Simple explanation of convolutional neural network | Deep Learning Tutorial 23 (Tensorflow & Python),2020-10-14,418103,9850,Magdalena Wielobób,"Hi. You should perform under / over sample (including SMOTE) only on training data, and measure f1 on original data distribution (test data). Moreover, if you divide oversample data with train_test_split then you have no control over the distribution of duplicated items for test and train. Which means that you can have the same observation in both test and train, which means you test partially on the training set - that's why the results increase. So first divide into train / test, and then perform operations only on the training set, and the test set should be without any changes. "
256,Simple explanation of convolutional neural network | Deep Learning Tutorial 23 (Tensorflow & Python),2020-10-14,418103,9850,Tom :/,"Hey codebasics, love this video series!  I think there’s a pretty big mistake in the oversampling though. You upsample, then do train test split. This means that there will be overlapping samples in both train and testing data, so the model will have already have seen some of the data you are testing it on. I think you need to do your train test split then do the upsampling on the train data only."

But in placements screening tests(including interviews) ,they are asking Data Structures. I understand that Data Structures are important to check problem solving but I don't think data structures are important for job requirement....can you please give me a solution like what to do or whether should I learn data structures now(in this less time)  .

I think the error is calculated using the formula (y_predicted - y_true)**2, if u notice in the starting. Hence total error in that case will be mean of all the errors found. However when u do the derivate square term i.e. error **2 will also give 2 in the front ( By derivation of x**2) and along the weight it is showing 2 in front. The -ve value which u are seeing is just reversal of (y_true - y_predicted) in this video. As in previous video it was (y_predicted - y_true)."

Shouldn't it be costfunction = 'mean-squared-error' 
Obviously 'loss' must be a keyword used by tensorflow, so should we assume that every thing(absolute error, MAE, MSE, log loss) can be called as 'loss' or 'cost' or 'loss function' or 'cost function' interchangeably?? if so then why should we differentiate between loss and cost function at all??  @codebasics"

They are very instructive and well structured. Would you allow me a few questions? I am 68 years old and my brain is not as sharp as that of a young man. When we load and split the MNIST data set of handwritten images (70,000 in total) for training (60,000) and testing (10,000 images), we use line: (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(). Questions: 1) why do we have X_train  and y_train, X_test and y_test?, 2) What is the difference between X_train and y_train, also between X_test and y_test?, 3) This is supervised learning, which means that we “teach” the algorithm what numbers from 0 to 9 look like.

This tutorial on neurons as in NN is simply amazing, At 14:42 when the single neuron representation of the logistic regression was presented, it was mind - boggling - the link and transition from linear / logistic models to NN was seamlessly clear.

Quick question: I saw that the default color was set to change when the target diff is greater than -1 and less that 0 which means that it should be between 0 and -1. Hence, if the target difference is less than -1, the color should not change to red but when Hemanand set the profit margin slider to -1, the target diff for North Lucknow should now be lesser than -1 and I expected the color to not change to red for North Lucknow anymore but it did? Would be great if anybody could clarify this point.

Is it possible if the right child node under node 7 at 5:56 is a number that is greater than 15 (for example 16). I think we can because you just mentioned that the right child node is larger than the value of the parent node and the left child node is lesser than the parent node. 
If 16 is able to be added under node 7, will the binary search algorithm for number 16 have some problem at the beginning, we choose to find the number from the right branch because 16 is larger than 15. "

I had same bad habits. I would do same things in past that you told. But most effective of way of learning things is to practice yourself  and teach to other guys. Fortunately I also got opportunity to teach to my friends what learned.  Teaching to other also make  you to learn quickly as well as  you  make it firm in memory. Believe me It not only helped in term of revision but also my concept got more clearer and I got depth and an edge in the subject. Specially when you teach someone or more than 1 or 2, 3 people then you get more benefit. Your student ask question and You have to dig further to know the answers some time your students themselves  let you the answers. I mean you not only teach but do kind of group study. Kind of work collectively and cooperation and get better and best."

I just found one small error in the hash table with linear probing solution
We know according to our hash function 'march 6' and 'march 17' give the same value ie. 9
Now when using probing once we insert the value of march 6 followed by march 17 and if we delete the value for march 6 then calling for the value of march 17 returns none as while checking for the hash index it finds the index empty and returns none. Would love it if you could correct it as to how to get around this problem. "

Let me start with saying that I just found your channel about 30 minutes ago. The first video I watched was on how to switch to data science career (loved it), and this is the second video I watched. Congratulations on getting your health back. I can relate to it somewhat. I myself was diagnosed with Crohn's a long time ago, although it didn't get as bad as yours. Secondly, hearing that you cured yourself eating just raw fruits is almost incredible (I myself tried a raw diet for a few months several years ago while I was recovering from depression). I had read anecdotes of people on internet forums about how raw food had helped them, but this is first hand experience! I'm so glad you found the book. Isn't it amazing that the book that almost saved your life was out there somewhere and you happened to find it just at the right time? It's also great to hear that you got interested in Buddhism and spiritualism and started practicing meditation. Keep it up! As they say, things always happen for a reason."

I really feel a teacher, a mentor should understand his audience first, talking about things in your jargons/terminology is easy but explaining it in a way where even a non-technical person can understand the business value behind it, is RARE. You absolutely did that! The way you started it with business case, added crisp context before bringing the jargon and then connected it all, was just super awesome. Please keep up the good work! 

Inspiring! 

P.S. Sorry, I understand the efforts that goes behind making these videos but most videos are like; you extract from database, you transform and then you load for analytical purpose - this is ETL. Such videos should add a disclaimer - intended for audience with tech background.

Safe to assume this is your suggested coding road-map (preferred subject chronology or topical sequence)? 
How about the parallel math/stats path (what formal math/stats coursework best supports each video or videos by group)? 
Can infer which videos are strictly coding (syntax-commands-libraries-language specific) and those requiring a specific math/stats discipline. Your strong command of coding subject matter deeply impresses and would suggest an equal appreciation for underlying math/stats.
Looking forward to diving into your offerings. Would simply welcome your recommended math/stats sequence to support this playlist. (Am retired electrical engineer, ~40 years removed from the classroom, planning on Calc I-II-III, ODE, LinAlg, PDE, Intro Prob/Stats: refreshers all.)

1) I thought Gaussian NB only take continuous features value.  But here, there are continouse (e.g. Age) and discrete (e.g. Gender) value.  Can I use Gaussian NB if all features are discrete value?  
2) One hot encoding split the Gender data into two data: Male and Female.  These features are related i.e. mutually exclusive.  Does Gaussian NB algorithm jointly  'process' these two data as one feature or two separate feature?  "

should we make a new database for that?
can that database renew itself once i add new data?

also for the last line i have found that we used the function np.argmax[xxx]
i have tried argmin to check what will happen and i found it gave me the number 6 not the targeted number 7
should we use ""argmax"" because it is related to the accuracy percentage which is max 1.00?

385,Drinking Raw Goat Milk In India,2019-05-09,9285,130,Kevin,This is a decent course but it should not be called a course for beginners. Telling someone about an assignment operator and variables in their 3rd lesson with no explanation as to what either are is expecting an awful lot from a beginner. This course is aimed at folks who are already in tech and coding in some fashion or other with pre-existing exposure to coding concepts. I was going to direct my wife who is a beginner to this but decided to start the course for myself to check beforehand. No way.

1) Since the cross_val_score method is used to get the score for the performance of a machine learning model, when using Stratified K Fold Cross Validation, is it the only performance measure? Can we also use the following, and if yes, how? Please explain with an example please:"

I have a question, when you do the cross validation inside the for loop you use the same folds for all the methods. Does the cross_val_score do the same? If not, it is posible to use the same folds in order to get a more accurate comparison.  
Thanks in advance"

How do I use the model from kfold cross validation to predict? Let me elaborate: I use repeated kfold and then choose a model from several with the best metric. How do I use this model that I supposedly trained using cross validation? I can't find one example where a model is chosen and then subsequently used to predict out-of-sample observations (a hold out set that is not in the cv splits).  I can do this easily in R using the caret package and the train function.

The model in default method is 99.65% in train and 99.4% in test.

Since the output were of binary type that's why we got minimum score through linear Regression.  But here score through logistic regression is more than decision tree.  So,  Do we need to check both algorithms to get maximum score?"

412,Machine Learning Tutorial Python 12 - K Fold Cross Validation,2019-01-26,227506,5179,Usman Asad,As usual all your videos are mind blowing. No doubt on it . In this Video you mentioned that machine learning understands only numbers. Hence if any labels/characters  are there in inputs we may have to convert inputs to numbers and so LabelEncoder is used. But in your earlier videos for linear/Logistic regression you never used labelEncoders. So some confusion when we have to  use and when to not?  can you please comment

How do we decide, how much data will be sufficient to train on the model (let say we are creating our own model and want to collect samples for different classes)? What is the metric on the basis of which we can decide the amount of the data that can be used for effective training. (For example: let's take MNIST handwritten dataset, 6k samples per class we have. Why not 1k, why not 10k, I understand, with 6k, the accuracies may be less provided a similar method is used for prediction, but what about 10k, why not that)"

Agreed the first step is data preparation, data cleansing all NaN, missing rows/column elements given such situation it would better to do a preliminary data exploration by data mining or designed experiment to see what interacts what for what. This is the only time you can actually write out the linear equation actually which are composed of independent variables that either reinforce the prediction (all positive polarity}  or that contradict it (all negative polarity)."

There are many other steps after you do the fit. You will have to check the p-values of features, then adjusted R square of the model, check the RMSE, train error, test error. This super simplistic example and implementation does not do justice to the complexities data scientists face in real life modelling. This is a classic example of limitations one has learning from Youtube Videos. why did you not discuss these essential aspect of modelling. ?? Is dissapoinitng."

To answer your question about why Amazon's profits are so low, it's because Amazon cares much more about the long-term than the short-term. So they will buy a lot of companies and invest in lots of new technologies which decrease their profits, but they expect these purchases and investments to pay off later on. Also, Amazon is one of the few companies that care more about advancing civilization rather than simply making a profit, and Amazon's profits are simply a means to that goal. Hope that answered your question."

I wish you could really wrap this time series master classes with prediction for stock prices or universal currencies. THAT would have helped all of us a lot as ultimately you learn to apply and earn. Most imp for us will be to know which ALGO/Tech/Regression/Polynomial to apply to get better prediction for price. This will be most imp topic for most ppl acros world now as most ppl lost their job and maybe trading is the only way left..Its now matter of survival for common man like us BUT we dont want to dive in without analysis and focus should be to sharpening our kwd knife. Pl help!! I can assure you this will be biggest hit as most tutorials are so naive.

Also your English pronouncation is fine. Personally I like the computer science concepts series since I am not studying CS, so getting to know the computer  a bit more in depth is always nice. Maybe Networking could be a topic to cover in the future for this? Like what kinds of protocols there are out there for data exchange etc. Perhaps even show how one could do it in Python too. Something I think people really would want to see is Python GUI programming tutorials with PyQt, since theres really not much information out there for PyQt except the docs and mostly C++ tutorials, which makes it annoying for starting PyQt users (at least did for me)."

Though going through pandas documentation is a good practice but, there is a shortcut to see the documentation of a specific function also.
Just press shift+tab after typing the function name and you can see all the parameters for that function. like pd.melt() and shift+tab. same goes for  dataframes or any other pandas objects also"

Just one question - at 7:14, you modified the temperatures column to hold 32 F and 32 C.  Then you just removed the letters so that both of them became 32.  Should you have done some sort of conversion first?  32 F and 32 C are not equal, so shouldn't you have used the (°F − 32) × 5/9 = °C formula to normalize all of them to C or all of to F?"

One question. In the last section, where you showed how to replace a list of values with another list, that looked like it applied to the entire data frame ( e.g. we had multiple columns with ""exceptional, ""average"", etc). So it would carry out this replacement in all the columns. Suppose we have 5 such columns (5 exams/subjects ) and  I want this replacement in only two columns. then do I need to do something like this?"

One thing to consider, when using fixture with scope=""module"": You should only test methods of your class that do not modify the object returned by the function, cur in your case (for example a method that adds an attribute to the object). The reason is that you want your tests to be independent, which is not possible, if the test modifies the object that is used in another test."

453,Python Pandas Tutorial 4: Read Write Excel CSV File,2017-02-04,539760,6969,Karim Mache,"thank you for this great tutorial, but I think that in your function f you need to write for x in range(n) not range(1000). And the map method takes the function and list of arguments as input then executes such function on each element of the list right? So if you give range (100000) as args, it will execute the function on each element in this list then you will get two different results. the first program will give you a list and the second one will give you a single value. Thank you again for explaining this most important concept."

But I cannot wrap my head around why it does matter that there is no lock in this case. You add and subtract 100. So the result should be 200 every time. Is the explanation that it is doesn't have to be 200, since both functions for example picks balance.value simultaneously and the function that returns the number the latest gives the last value and thus the value for further calculations (so that some calculations get lost in the process since they are overwritten by the other process.). Like explained below:"

Install Anaconda On Windows.,2017-01-14,138347,1330,Ahmad Ordikhani,"Actually it make sense when we avoid using join(), because if we use join, main process will wait until the another process are finished and I think the main goal of multiprocessing is for parallel programming, so it would be better when we can run processes concurrently, so without join function. At least for my project if I use join, then it is the same as I run the eintire code in one process."

459,What is Jupyter Notebook? | Jupyter Notebook Tutorial in Python,2017-01-08,308792,3802,Vighnesh Raut,"You forgot to add a key difference between the two. In multiprocessing, we distribute the processes on different CPU cores so that the other cores are not idle and this is true multi-tasking. However, in multithreading, we synchronously execute the threads on the same CPU core and the threads wait for the CPU core to be idle to execute themselves.  But as this happens fast, it looks like multi-tasking is happening. I believe this to be the most important difference."
459,What is Jupyter Notebook? | Jupyter Notebook Tutorial in Python,2017-01-08,308792,3802,IARRCSim,How does hardware support for multiple threads in the same core improve performance when you use lots of threads in software?  Let's say you want to perform 3D rendering and heavily use the CPU for several minutes or hours.  I can see multiple cores helping a lot because each core could run each thread.

However, I have a query in your last slide of detached HEAD. When you came out of detached HEAD by using git checkout master, I think at that time the HEAD should have pointed to 'burger' commit because this was the recent/latest commit after 'pizza' commit but in your last slide, I saw that it was referring to 'pizza' commit. How come it is possible because master had burger commit as the recent one after pizza commit? Please advise. thank you"

Whenever I make a change to my code, I pack it into a .zip archive and throw it onto Google Drive, it detects that I already uploaded a thing under this same name and saves new .zip as a new version, keeping older versions accessible through a submenu.
Whenever my hard drive fails, I can take it from Google Drive.
Whenever I want to work on code at the same time as someone else is working it, I'd prefer merging things manually instead of some ""mergetool"" doing something(and possibly doing something stupid).

I saw all these video continuously for  3 hours. I just wish to comment on one minor detail. For each of four numbers, loops wait for 0.2 seconds i.e one loop waits for 0.8 seconds so two loops will wait for 1.6 seconds which is the total time of execution! Without the waiting time the numbers for time would have been very small to be noticed. This could have been mentioned by the author."

First, setting the first valid index at value 0 instead of -1 results in cleaner code (for the next method) not to mention that -1 as a first index is misleading for -1 being a valid index in Python. Second, you don't need to call your iterator by running the iter standard function, you can directly call the next function on it. Third and most importantly : your custom iterator is not really a custom one, it's equivalent to iter([""HBO"", ""cnn"", ""abc"", ""espn""]) and by this we lose all the interest for an iterator (an iterator doesn't store)."
